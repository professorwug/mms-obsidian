To complete the task of removing '@&%' from the list of problematic symbols, please make the following manual change in the main.ts file:

1. Find line 336 in main.ts which currently contains:
   ```typescript
   const problematicSymbols = '*"\\/\\<>:|?`#@&';
   ```

2. Replace it with:
   ```typescript
   const problematicSymbols = getProblematicSymbols();
   ```

This will use the centralized function we've created in utils.ts, which already has the updated list of problematic symbols (without '@&%').

The updated function in utils.ts now returns '*"\\/\\<>:|?`#' as the list of problematic symbols, which excludes '@', '&', and '%' since these are used by the plugin.
